-a  --all    List all files, even those with names that begin with a
period, which are normally not listed (that is, hidden).

-A  --almost-all    Like the -a option except it does not list . (current directory) and .. (parent directory).

-d  --directory    Ordinarily, if a directory is specified, ls will list the
contents of the directory, not the directory itself. Use this
option in conjunction with the -l option to see details
about the directory rather than its contents.

-F--  classify    This option will append an indicator character to the
end of each listed name. For example, it will append a
forward slash (/) if the name is a directory.

-h  --human-readable    In long format listings, display file sizes in human-
readable format rather than in bytes.

-r  --reverse    Display the results in reverse order. Normally, ls displays its results in ascending alphabetical order.

-S    Sort results by file size.

-t    Sort by modification time.
